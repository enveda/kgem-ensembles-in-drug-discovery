# HPO configurations

To reproduce the results, you can ensure you use the same pipeline we used by checking the hpo_config.json of each model in https://zenodo.org/records/7002695.
The best hyperparameters found are located in each model for each KG under /best_pipeline as well as the metrics for each of the 30 trials (trials.tsv).
