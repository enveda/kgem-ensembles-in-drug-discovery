Non-Commercial and Academic Software License Terms
==================================================

IMPORTANT NOTE: These Non-Commercial and Academic Software License Terms only permit the use of the LICENSED MATERIALS for NON-COMMERCIAL PURPOSES, as set forth herein. Any person who wishes to make any use of the LICENSED MATERIALS for any purpose other than for NON-COMMERCIAL PURPOSES must not do so under this present AGREEMENT, but will need to obtain from LICENSOR under a separate agreement and against payment of a license fee the right to use the LICENSED MATERIALS for such purposes. In order to obtain such license for commercial purposes, contact LICENSOR under support@envedabio.com. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this AGREEMENT shall be construed as an obligation of LICENSOR to enter into such agreement or to grant such license.

Preamble
--------

A.	Enveda Biosciences ("LICENSOR") has developed software (including any modifications as may be made available by LICENSOR during the TERM, the "SOFTWARE"). The SOFTWARE is available in source code form for download in this repository (https://github.com/enveda/kgem-ensembles-in-drug-discovery/) for use in the Python environment.

B.	In order to support certain non-commercial and academic activities, LICENSOR is willing to license the SOFTWARE, along with certain other materials, to LICENSEE under these II Non-Commercial and Academic Software License Terms (the "AGREEMENT"), subject to the terms and conditions of this AGREEMENT, free of charge and against no consideration for NON-COMMERCIAL PURPOSES only.

Now, therefore, LICENSOR and LICENSEE (each a "PARTY" and collectively the "PARTIES") agree as follows:

1. Definitions
--------------

Capitalized terms used in this AGREEMENT shall have the meanings assigned to them next to where the term is printed in quotation marks and in capital letters in the body of this AGREEMENT. In addition, the following terms shall have the meaning defined in this Article 1:

"COMMERCIAL PURPOSE" shall be any purpose that is not a NON-COMMERCIAL PURPOSE.

"DOCUMENTATION" shall mean any materials, in electronic or written form, of LICENSOR made available to LICENSEE during the TERM relating to the SOFTWARE, including, without limitation, user guides, tutorial and other instruction materials made available by LICENSOR.

"LICENSED MATERIALS" shall mean the SOFTWARE, the SAMPLE DATA and the DOCUMENTATION as well as any further material or information, or any part thereof, made available by LICENSOR during the TERM under or in relation to this AGREEMENT.

"LICENSEE" shall mean either (i) the legal entity on whose behalf (either by its employees, di-rectors or officers) the SOFTWARE is downloaded and/or installed and/or by whom the rights granted under this AGREEMENT are exercised, or, if LICENSEE is not a legal entity as in (i), (ii) the individual who downloads and/or installs the SOFTWARE and/or who exercises the rights granted under this AGREEMENT.

"LICENSEE DATA" shall mean (i) any of LICENSEE'S own data that LICENSEE feeds into or processes using the SOFTWARE, and (ii) any data that are the output of the processing of LICENSEE DATA by the SOFTWARE. For the avoidance of doubt, LICENSEE DATA shall not include any data included in the SOFTWARE code, in the SAMPLE DATA or that is otherwise made available by LICENSOR to LICENSEE.

"NON-COMMERCIAL PURPOSES" shall mean purposes which do neither directly nor indirectly serve any commercial purposes of LICENSEE and/or of any third party. Internal academic and internal research purposes of LICENSEE, as well as non-commercial uses for governmental purposes by a LICENSEE who is a governmental authority, shall be deemed NON-COMMERCIAL PURPOSES, provided in each case that they are not carried out with the aim of obtaining, directly or indirectly, a financial benefit for LICENSEE or a third party. For the avoidance of doubt, any use of the SOFTWARE for or on behalf of any third party (e.g., such as for providing any kind of services or work product, whether for commercial purposes or otherwise, to third parties, which involve, in their provision or preparation, any use of the SOFTWARE) shall be deemed to serve COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.

"SAMPLE DATA" shall mean sample data that is made available by LICENSOR together with or in relation to the SOFTWARE for the purpose of testing and documenting the algorithm.

2. Parties and Execution of the AGREEMENT
-----------------------------------------

By downloading and/or installing the SOFTWARE, and/or by exercising any of the rights grant-ed under this AGREEMENT, LICENSEE acknowledges and agrees to the terms and conditions of, and to be bound by, this AGREEMENT and that the AGREEMENT shall be a valid and en-forceable agreement between LICENSOR and LICENSEE.
